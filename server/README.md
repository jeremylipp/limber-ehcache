### Docker image definition for Terracotta Server

#### Introduction

The Terracotta 5.x OSS offering includes the following:

 *  Ehcache 3.x compatibility
 *  Distributed In-Memory Data Management with fault-tolerance via Terracotta Server (1 stripe â€“ active with optional mirror)
 *  In memory off-heap storage - take advantage of all the RAM in your server

The current image is based on the [openjdk:8-jdk-alpine image](https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk/), and adds [Terracotta 5.6.4 OSS on top of it](http://terracotta.org/downloads/open-source/catalog)

#### How to start your Terracotta Server(s) in Docker containers

##### Quick start : one active node

    docker run --name tc-server -p 9410:9410 -d terracotta/terracotta-server-oss:5.6.4

A quick look at the logs :
